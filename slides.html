# Overview

1. What is SQL? and the Query process
2. Overview of the SELECT statement
3. Efficient Retrieval
4. SQL Workbench, execution paths, and basic query tuning

---

# What is SQL?

**S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage is a declarative language used to communicate with a _relational_ database.
- Operates on a relational Database
> _Note_: Relational in this case refers to the table, row, column relation, not the relationship between tables!
- Makes declarations about a relational structure but does not define how these actions should be executed

---

# Query Processing

## Client Side 
1. Define Reporting Requirements
> What data is required?
2. SQL Query
> _Declare_ what is needed

---
## Server Side
<ol start="3">
  <li>Query Cache</li>
    If the query has appeared before with the exact same text, SQL will return the cached results
  <li>Parser/Translator</li>
    Any syntax errors would be caught in this stage, also does Name resolutions, Type derivation, and aggregate binding
  <li>Preprocessor</li>
    Checks things like making sure the table, columns, functions exist
  <li>Database Optimizer</li>
    The Optimizer generates several possible plans and chooses the best one using an internal algorithm
</ol>

---

<ol start="7">
    <li>Implementation (Execution Plan)</li>
</ol>
> The least expensive plan (considering I/O, CPU, and memory) is executed

<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
      subgraph client-side
      A(Reporting<br>Requirements)-->B(SQL)
      end
</div>
<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
      subgraph SQL-engine-side
      C{Parser/<br>Translator}-->D
      D{Preprocessor}-->E
      E{Optimizer}-->F
      F{Execution<br>Plan}-->G{Execution<br>Engine}
      end
</div>

> The SQL Query describes _what_ should be retrieved, the optimizer will generate _how_ it should be retrieved

---

# The **SELECT** Statement
The parts of a select statement are:
1. FROM: Which tables
2. WHERE: Conditions on rows
3. GROUP BY: Combining rows
4. HAVING: filtering by conditions on that grouping
5. SELECT: Choosing which columns to return
6. ORDER BY: Sorting for returned entries
7. LIMIT: How many rows should be returned
> This is the logical query processing flow and the order in which the server interprets any SELECT statement
```SQL
SELECT [column(s)]
FROM [table(s)]
WHERE [condition(s)]
GROUBY [grouping(s)]
HAVING [group condition(s)]
ORDERBY [column(s)]
LIMIT [number of rows];
```

# Indexes

- Creating an index creates a new special lookup table and data structures that refers to the original table
- Indexes can be created on any column (not only id!) but should only be created on columns that are frequently referenced in a query's WHERE clause and infrequently updated
- There are clustered and non clustered indexes, they are both represented with a Binary Tree structure
- A clustered index stores the entire row and all the data (affects the sorting of the table as a whole) while a non clustered index stores a pointer to the data
- A table can only have one clustered index (often the primary key)
- Clustered indexes can speed up SELECTs (if used correctly), but can slow down INSERTs and UPDATEs (mostly clustered)
- Non clustered indexes can also speed up SELECTs (if used correctly) but add overhead since they are their own data structure that must be stored

---

# Views 

- Views are nothing more than a SQL statement stored in the DB, so there are no speed benefits in using them
- Views instead allow us to store a common query and write permissions and business logic around it
- Incorporating views into other queries can cause retrieval to be slow as it requires rerunning the stored SQL statement every time it is referenced
